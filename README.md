# Observations and Analysis
  # Scatter Plot
    We will create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between two variables. We'll place "Fuel And Light" on the X-axis and plot        two separate figures for the Y-axis, containing the variables 'Personal care and effects' and 'Transport and communication.' As             evident from the resulting plot, there is a strong correlation between 'Transport and communication' and 'Fuel And Light.'

  # Bar Plot
    The figures display the distribution of data points across various price ranges for fruits.

  # Box Plot
    The Vegetable index exhibits its highest variability in November and December, reaching its lowest point in July and August. Notably,       the month of July contains some outlier index values, while August does not display such outliers.
